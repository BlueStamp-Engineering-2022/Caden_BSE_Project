Face Recognition Door Lock
A camera connected to a Raspberypi captures the user's face. It uploads the image to an API (Amazon Rekognition) which uses facial recognition to determine whether to open the lock. If the open response is sent back the arduino toggles a motor which opens the lock.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up and hooking up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my tv. The heatsinks, the sd card, and the controller were all added to ensure that the Raspberry Pi was working. Instead of the Raspberry Pi Os software, I had to first download a different software called Retro Pie. With Retro Pie, I needed to download an Imager for Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi Imager automatically downloads a list of the latest versions of Raspbian supported by the Raspberry Pi. Raspbian is the typical Raspberry Pi Os software, the one I needed on the Raspberry Pi was Retro Pi. With the included SD card, I plugged in the SD into my computer and launched the Imager. The imager allowed me to set the Operating System to Retro Pi instead of Raspbian onto the SD card. With the OS imaged onto the SD, I plugged the SD card back into the Raspberry Pi and rebooted the system and Retro Bi booted up.

# Starter Project

My starter project the useless machine was elegantly simple. It doesn't use any computing chips or controllers just logic from a simple circuit. The useless machine is a box with a conspicuous switch. When the switch is toggled an arm emerges from a door and closes the switch. The arm then returns. I first soldered the switch, terminals, lights, resisters, and a small pressure switch to a printed circuit board. I hooked the PCB to the motor and a battery pack. Then I constructed the box surrounding the internal components. When I first started I assumed there would need to a seperate mechanism to open the door but the arm itself pushes it open.
